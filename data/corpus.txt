- Yow, I don't know if you realize this,
I often bend over backwards
trying to figure out a way
to respectfully convey my criticism.
But I'm not gonna take
the time to do that today
because this is one of the
dumbest brain dead takes
I've ever seen in my life.
- [Announcer] This is a new show.
(upbeat music)
(monkey chatters)
- 'Sup, you beautiful bastards.
Welcome back to "The
Philip DeFranco Show",
your daily dive into the news.
Hope you had a fantastic Monday
evening, Tuesday morning.
We've got a lot of interesting
and important news to talk about today.
But first, I'm very excited to announce
the brand new mini drop
over at beautifulbastard.com
just went live,
including the brand new
"I don't know where I'm going,
but I know it'll be an
adventure" shirts and hoodies,
"The only constant is change" gear,
newest evolution of the "Yeah,
no, I'm fine" T and crew,
and you demanded it and
so I'm giving it to you,
the unvaulting of the "Go
easy on yourself" T, crew,
and the introduction of the tank.
All available first come, first served
over beautifulbastard.com
along with our other classic bestsellers.
To jump in on that, treat yourself.
Also, thank you for supporting the show,
but we got a lot of
news to talk about today
so let's just jump into it.
Starting with, so there's
this huge controversy
that just broke out,
there's also now backlash,
and it's all centered
around the future of AI,
the Humane AI Pin and
Marques Brownlee AKA MKBHD.
Well, this is a huge situation
in the world of tech.
Even if you don't care about tech,
this goes past that.
Right, so let me explain.
The Humane AI Pin, it's supposed
to be this wearable device
that sends messages and makes calls.
And the company says that the pin acts
as your assistant and second brain.
Seemingly, a swing at something
meant to replace an iPhone,
or at the very least, work in conjunction
where you're not looking at
your device all the time.
But that's me oversimplifying it.
Getting into some specifics,
the pin doesn't have a screen.
Instead of a display, it
projects imagery onto your palm
and it handles tasks and
searches via your voice.
It can also translate languages,
identify objects and provide
information about them,
take photos and more.
But, the early reviews of the
product they just released
are not very flattering.
With places like Bloomberg
putting out a review
called "The AI Device Revolution
Isn't Going to Kill the Smartphone",
with the review noting that the device
is just so slow answering questions.
It also can't do basic
things like set a timer
or access a calendar or third party apps.
We've also seen plenty of
criticisms about bad battery life.
You also had some saying it looks creepy
to have a little camera-equipped
device on your shirt
when you're out in public,
and Bloomberg adding,
"The company acknowledges
that the device is a version 1.0,
but it feels even earlier than that."
Meanwhile, you had The
Verge, for example, noting
there were some tools that
it had that were useful.
Like it could recognize a restaurant
and tell you if it has good reviews,
and it's also nice to be
able to do a simple task
without needing to get your phone out
and then getting accidentally
sucked into TikTok.
But The Verge also noting
that it was super inconsistent
and failed to do a lot of
simple tasks like make calls,
and adding, "the one and only thing
I can truly rely on the AI
Pin to do is tell me the time.
Should you buy this thing?
That one's easy.
Nope. Nuh-uh.
I can't think of anyone
to whom I'd recommend
spending the $699 for the device
and the $24 monthly subscription."
And then all of that bringing
us to Marques Brownlee,
who put out a video of his own
agreeing with many of
those points and saying
it is the worst product he ever reviewed.
Though notably, he did give
credit where it was due,
saying he found the
hardware to be impressive
and the way that you
use your hand to control
the projections that it's fairly intuitive
all things considered.
But notably, he also said that
it just has a lot of problems
even with just asking it questions.
- It's often wrong,
because AI still can hallucinate
and there are still issues with it
just not understanding correctly
or just saying the wrong thing.
- [Philip] MKBHD also noting
that it gets overheated,
that it's often warm, and
it's just hard to forget
that you have a warm square on your chest.
Also saying that it lacks apps
or you can't call an Uber,
or order something on Amazon.
Though when it comes to shopping,
he would hesitate to even try
because it would just be
easier to do on a phone.
- I've seen a lot of demos,
where someone's like,
"Plan me a trip to Europe."
Plan me an expedition."
I don't even wanna buy
detergent online on this
because I need to check all
the ratings and the titles
and make sure I'm ordering the right one.
I do not trust that with just my voice.
- And even though you have
outlets like The Washington Post
saying this product is not
trying to be an iPhone killer,
you have some arguing
that it's pretty clear
Humane might be hoping for that.
Right, 'cause that potential
goal actually creates
one of the pin's biggest flaws,
it does not connect to your phone at all.
It gives you a different number
and it exists totally separate,
which is also why it
led Marques calling this
a victim of its future ambition.
- In order to get it to that future,
they can't set the precedent now
of connecting it to your phone,
'cause then that means they have to remove
that feature in the future,
and they don't wanna do that.
So this device, as it
exists today, is hamstrung
by its ideal future version of itself.
- And so interestingly with all this,
even though there were so
many bad reviews today,
MKBHD, likely because he is one
of the biggest creators in the world,
became the poster child
for not liking this device.
With some even using this situation
as a way to try to frame him
as this like careless villain,
with one of the most viral reactions
coming from Daniel Vassallo
who screenshotted
Marques' video and wrote,
"I find it distasteful, almost unethical,
to say this when you have
18 million subscribers.
Hard to explain why,
but with great reach comes
great responsibility.
Potentially killing someone
else's nascent project
reeks of carelessness.
First, do no harm."
Yow, I don't know if you realize this,
I often bend over backwards
trying to figure out a way
to respectfully convey my criticism.
But I'm not gonna take
the time to do that today
because this is one of the
dumbest brain dead takes
I've ever seen in my life.
We got Daniel out here
for some reason almost quoting Uncle Ben
and the "Hippocratic Oath"?
(deep voice) "Do no harm,"
like he's a doctor?
He's a tech reviewer,
and arguably saving people from spending
$700 plus a monthly fee
on something that arguably sucks.
Saving them the time and the frustration
and the hassle of even
if they can return it,
that could be seen as a social good.
And Marques, for those
that are unfamiliar,
if you watch through his stuff
you can see he's not one of these people
that loves to shit on products.
But you know, when it comes
to review channels or critics,
whether it be in tech or movies,
or TV shows, games, whatever,
you have a lot of those people
who love to tear things down.
That's not MKBHD,
which is also why his negative
reviews stand out so much.
And you don't even have to
just take his past videos
as a way to go like, "Okay,
where's this guy at?"
In the actual video that Marques put out
that you're so offended by,
he goes out of his way to split
the review into two parts,
what it is, what it's supposed to do,
it's capabilities.
Like, "Hey, tell me
what's in front of me,"
and it's pointing out cameras
and the carpet and that thing.
And then separately, his own
real world experiences with it.
And as people like Trung
Phan have pointed out,
like that is to Humane AI's benefit.
So when I see Lex Luther
from Wish just going like,
"I can't believe MKBHD would."
"Do no harm, Marques."
Like, my man, Omni, rightly pointed out,
Marquez's only
responsibility is to himself
and more importantly, his audience.
That is who at all times he
should be going out of his way
to make sure he does not harm.
That is the unspoken social
contract that exists.
It is not his job to run interference
or PR for a company that
publicly released a product,
it's $700 with a monthly fee
because version one of
their product is lackluster.
YouTube versions may be
great, maybe it's sped up,
maybe things get more accurate,
but this review is about the here and now
of what people can purchase
and what they'll get.
Now that said, I equally
don't understand the people
that just love the fact
that they get to shit on this product.
To me, that's somewhat weirdo behavior
because it's a lot of work
and it's so hard to try
to release something
that's actually new.
So I understand why some people
may be sensitive to criticisms
because a lot of those end up
getting kinda like bulked in
with the people that just, it's pure hate.
But those things are not one and the same.
But I guess, kind of
what I'm saying here is
don't be stupid, stupid.
And then, this news out
of Australia is horrible.
Because on Saturday there
was a bloody rampage
at the Bondi Junction
shopping mall in Sydney,
with this 40-year-old man
running around with a large knife
stabbing 18 people, killing
at least six of them.
With people seeing video of him
chasing horrified shoppers
taken from an upper level,
shopkeepers giving shelter to bystanders
locking their doors.
Some people trying to
block off the attacker,
others coming to the aid of victims
risking their own lives in the process.
With that including this lifeguard
who described the scene to "9News".
- And this lady, there
was just so much blood.
I've never seen that much blood,
and she had blood everywhere,
And we, me and two other
members of the public
and a few police, we were
just looking for wounds
and we were just sort of trying to stem
the bleeding as we could.
And as I looked up, I looked down
and there was just multiple victims
sort of like 50 meters apart.
- And included among those injured
was a 38-year-old mom who was stabbed
while trying to shield
her nine-month-old baby
from the attacker.
But despite her best efforts,
he still wounded the infant girl,
with reports describing how
the mom who was bleeding out
desperately clamored into a nearby store
and handed her baby off
to a group of bystanders.
And then, as another witness
were called to "Sky News",
almost everyone who was nearby
heard what happened next.
- We heard the gunshots.
I think, I'm not sure
if it was four or five,
but we heard gunshots and
that's when everyone just ran.
And everyone looked terrified
and people were locking
themselves in the stores.
- Those gunshots coming from the barrel
of a female police officer's firearm,
because reportedly this
killer lunged at her
and she shot him dead,
bringing this carnage to an end.
Though sadly, the suffering didn't stop
because more heartbreaking
news broke from the hospital
where the mother and her baby were rushed.
- Her baby went into surgery,
and her mom didn't make it.
- However, fortunately,
the baby's condition
has reportedly improved.
Now, as far as the killer,
we're still finding out details about him.
Reportedly, he was known
to Queensland police,
though not for anything significant.
It's also been reported
that he's been struggling
with mental illness since he was 17.
His father telling reporters
that he had recently
come off his medication,
and initially that's the
explanation police gave
for what caused him to do this.
With the assistant police
commissioner, on Sunday,
shooting down rumors from the far-right
that the killer was an Islamic terrorist.
- As I had said last night,
there is still, to this point,
nothing that we have.
No information we have received,
no evidence we have recovered,
no intelligence that we have gathered
that would suggest that this was driven
by any particular motivation,
ideology, or otherwise.
- But then you also had
another police commissioner
later telling ABC News that it was obvious
the killer targeted women in particular,
because reportedly five of the six people
that he killed were women,
and the one man, being a security guard
who tried to stop the killer.
And then, of the 12
people who were wounded,
only two were men.
And of those 12, as of filming,
four of them reportedly
have been released so far
while eight continue to receive care
and conditions ranging
from serious to stable.
You know, that gendered motive,
that was also backed up
by the killer's father
who told reporters.
- Because he wanted a girlfriend,
and he's got no social skills
and he was frustrated out of his brain.
- But the father also
apologizing to all the victims
and then getting extremely
emotional about the whole thing.
- I'm extremely sorry,
I'm heartbroken for you.
Look, this is so horrendous
that I can't even explain it.
I love my son.
I made myself a servant to my son
when I found out he had a mental illness.
I became his servant.
I did everything because I love that boy.
I love my son, I'd give my life for him.
I love him dearly.
And, you know, how do you love a monster?
Give birth to him?
Okay, he's my son,
and I'm loving a monster.
To you he's a monster,
to me he was a very sick boy.
Believe me, he was a very sick boy.
- So now, police are
investigating this massacre
and building a profile of the killer.
But then before the city could
even recover from that shock,
there was another brutal
stabbing just two days later.
With someone walking up to a bishop
right in the middle of a sermon
being live streamed
online from this church
and viciously stabbing
him in the neck and head.
With immediately, several churchgoers
rushing to his defense,
they were also stabbed themselves.
Though luckily, their
injuries were reportedly
non-life threatening.
Also, notably with this,
right after the police
got the incident under control,
hundreds of people
gathered outside the church
demanding that the attacker
be brought outside,
with 'em seen clashing with the cops
leading to at least a
couple more injuries.
The people throwing
stones, bricks and bottles,
damaging cars and police
deploying tear gas in response.
And there, we're now getting reports
that a suspect has been arrested,
and it turns out to be a 15-year-old boy.
But of course, all of this
is moving in real time.
Everything is still developing
and if anything comes
from the investigations
or anything here,
of course, we will talk about it.
And then, MI5 failed to prevent
that tragic bombing that happened
at Ariana Grande's concert
in Manchester back in 2017.
That, at least, is what
survivors of the incident
are alleging in this new lawsuit.
Right, and for those who don't know,
one, MI5 is the UK's counterintelligence
and security agency;
two, over 250 victims and
family members of the bombing
have filed a group claim against it
with the investigatory powers tribunal;
and three, even though the
lawyers representing them
didn't give further
comment beyond confirming
that the complaint was filed,
this notably comes a year
after an inquiry found
that MI5 missed the chance
to take investigative action
that could have stopped the bombing.
With that attack killing 22 people
and hundreds more getting injured
as they were leaving
Ariana Grande's concert
at Manchester Arena.
And the report found that there
were two pieces of evidence
assessed about the suicide bomber
who carried out the attack,
and had they been acted on,
officers could have surveilled
him and found the car
that the explosives were stored in.
But a report on that information
was never written up.
And with that, you actually
had the director general of MI5
saying that he regretted
that this intelligence
was not obtained.
And adding, "Gathering covert
intelligence is difficult,
but had we managed to seize
the slim chance we had,
those impacted might not have experienced
such appalling loss and trauma."
Though the report also
noted that even though
it was possible that quicker action
might have stopped the bombing,
it said it was, quote, "quite impossible"
to say definitively if any intervention
would've been fully effective.
And so all of that bringing
us to this lawsuit,
which again, there're very
few details out so far.
But, you did have The
New York Times reporting
that this actually appears
to be the first time MI5
has been sued for failing
to prevent a terror attack.
With it noting that holding
security groups accountable,
it's incredibly difficult.
For example, families of 9/11 victims
have tried for a long time,
but they haven't had tons of luck.
But with that, you also have
places like The Guardian
noting that the families of those affected
feel like they have to at least try.
Pointing to comments Andrew
Roussos made last year, right?
He's the father of an eight-year-old girl
who died at the concert.
And he previously said,
"It's the only way to learn.
Everybody learns by hitting
them hard in the pocket,
I'm sorry to say.
At 2017, we were at the highest alert
and everyone was warned of
an attack in this country.
So if they would have learned lessons,
they wouldn't have allowed the attacker
to walk into that arena.
So yes, MI5 have, for
me, most of the blame."
But, whether that argument has
any weight in the legal world
or even out there in the
court of public opinion,
we'll have to wait and see.
Though for one of those,
we won't have to wait
'cause I'd love for you to
leave comments down below

And then, it's not just you,
we have the President of Columbia
openly talking about World War III.
But not for anything having
to do with Columbia itself.
Instead, it's about the
potential for escalating violence
between Israel and Iran
to lead to a bigger war.
In that, connected to
Iran over the weekend
launching what many are calling
an unprecedented aerial attack on Israel,
which according to the
IDF included the firing
of at least 350 drones,
missiles, and rockets
launched by Iran and its allied groups
in Iraq, Yemen, and Lebanon.
Though notably, 99% of those
were intercepted by Israel,
the US, or other partners,
with a seven-year-old girl
living in an Arab Bedoin community,
which notably is not recognized
by the Israeli state,
being the only reported injury.
And so the reason that this is considered
an unprecedented attack
has nothing to do with it
being deadly or damaging.
Instead, it's just the
fact that it happened
the way it did at all.
And that's because this
is actually the first time
Iran has launched an
assault against Israel
from its own territories.
'Cause you know, Iran and
Israel have been involved
in a so-called Shadow War for decades,
with Iran largely acting
through groups like Hamas
as well as Hezbollah and the Houthis.
And this is a key part
of Israel's strategy
being targeted assassinations
of Iranian military leaders
and nuclear scientists.
And ever since the October 7th attacks
and in the midst of Israel's
ongoing war in Gaza,
things have started to heat up.
With the most significant escalation
before this weekend being
when suspected Israeli war
plane struck a building
that was part of an Iranian
embassy complex in Syria.
With that attack killing
several Iranian officials
and leading to Iran supreme
leaders speaking before
a massive crowd calling the attack
a violation of international
norms and vowing revenge.
So now that Iran has actually
followed through on those threats,
everyone's freaking out
because there is a fear
that this could be the thing
that finally plunges the Middle East
into a wider regional war.
So with that, you had the UN
holding an emergency meeting on Sunday.
Secretary-General António Guterres saying
that the Middle East
is, quote, on the brink.
- The people of the region
are confronting a real danger
of a devastating full scale conflict.
Now is the time to
diffuse and de-escalate.
Now is the time for maximum restraint.
- Also, at that meeting you had
Israel's Ambassador to
the UN urging the world
to stop ignoring Iran's
crimes and take action there.
In all this is the Iranian
Ambassador claimed that Iran
had only attacked military targets
in the occupied Palestinian territories.
Adding that Iran was
committed to de-escalation
and avoiding regional conflict,
but also saying this.
- If the US initiate military
operation against Iran,
its citizen, or its security and interest,
Iran will use its inherent right
to respond proportionately.
- And so that brings us to,
you know, the US response.
And to start there, Biden
released a statement on Saturday
condemning the Iranian assault.
Also announcing that he'd bring together
fellow G7 leaders to coordinate
a united diplomatic response
to Iran's brazen attack.
And that meeting actually
took place yesterday
with the emphasis reportedly
being on non-military actions
that would, quote, limit the
prospects of a wider war.
With that, the G7 also
releasing a statement
re-affirming support for Israel
and accusing Iran of, quote,
"provoking an uncontrollable
regional escalation".
Which, you know, is a
pretty odd choice of words
when the whole point of
the meeting was ostensibly
to control the regional escalation.
But, anyways, and perhaps more notably,
Biden has reportedly said that the US
will not participate in any
offensive action against Iran.
And he's been on the phone with Netanyahu
privately advising the Israeli PM
against attacking Iran as well.
Apparently arguing that Israel
successfully demonstrated
its military superiority this weekend,
making a further response unnecessary.
But of course, whether Netanyahu
actually takes Biden's advice,
that remains an open question.
You know, as I'm recording this,
Israel's war cabinet is
still weighing its options.
And though Israel has reportedly
told the United States
that it is, quote, "not looking
for a significant escalation with Iran",
one Israeli official has
also vowed to, quote,
"build a regional coalition
and exact the price from Iran
in the fashion and timing
that is right for them."
And in general, there's
a lot of disagreement
over what the best way to
avoid escalation actually is.
For example, Nomi Bar-Yaacov,
an expert on Middle East politics,
told The New York Times that Iran
has made it, quote, "abundantly clear
that they consider the attack over."
And that the response should at most be
an attack on Iranian assets abroad,
but not in the country itself.
But speaking with The
Associated Press, Bradley Bowman
from the Foundation of
the Defense of Democracies
cautioned against being too soft on Iran.
And though he didn't specifically advocate
for direct strikes on the country,
he did say the US should make Iran, quote,
"regret this attack."
- [Bowman] We all want
to avoid a regional war,
but the question's how
do you best achieve it?
And my point is that if our adversaries
are left with the impression
that avoiding war is the
most important thing for us,
then you're simply inviting aggression.
- With him going on in that clip to say
he's not only talking about
sending a message to Iran,
but also to US adversaries
like Russia and China.
And so also with that, there's a new push
by lawmakers in the US to reaffirm
the country's support for
Israel and other allies.
With nearly a hundred representatives,
both Democrats and
Republicans, signing a letter
in the wake of the Iranian attacks,
urging Mike Johnson to
immediately bring a bill
that includes aid for Israel
as well as Ukraine and Taiwan
before the House floor.
Of course, that, as aid for Israel,
has become an increasingly
contentious issue in the US.
And to that point,
while we've talked about
Iran's aggression and violations
of international laws,
it is of course also the case
that Israel still stands
accused of genocide
and a host of other crimes.
And all this is more than
33,000 people have been killed
according to the Gaza Health Ministry.
And even just today, you had
thousands of Palestinians
attempting to return home to northern Gaza
allegedly coming under Israeli fires.
As you know, part of the point here being
that all of this is incredibly complex
in the sense of there're just so many
different things happening
and so many different
levers that could be pulled
that then affect all the other things.
With that, I'll leave it there for now
and ask you what are your thoughts here?
And then, let's talk
about this controversy
around STIs and your privacy.
Right, 'cause it's connected
to this healthcare app
that's out there right now called Calmara,
which claims that it can
identify up to 10 STIs
based on a picture of your genitals.
With that, including everything
from herpes to syphilis, HPV and others.
And Calmara claims that not only
can the AI powering the app do this,
but that it can actually
do it in under 60 seconds
and with an accuracy rating of 96%.
And this company might just be a sign
of where the industry is going
as AI companies continue to swear
that their algorithms can
do more and more and more.
However, whether it's
Calmara or another company,
there are major concerns
about efficacy and privacy.
I mean, looking at Calmara,
again, many experts are
shocked that they can claim
96% accuracy based just on a photo.
Now, there's a reason that most STI tests
use blood samples and direct swabs.
It's because the vast
majority are asymptomatic.
Like in your head you might think,
"Oh, well something like herpes
is obvious because it shows",
but it's really not the case.
Most cases never actually
have an outbreak.
And even when they do,
it's for relatively
short periods at a time.
And it's the same story with
something like syphilis.
The initial symptoms often include a sore
and then it goes away.
Unless you're catching these things
right when they're happening,
there's no real way for the app to know.
And it completely misses
other far more common STIs
like gonorrhea or chlamydia,
but both having pretty
easy to miss symptoms.
And then for the times
where it's not easy to miss,
it's pretty obvious that
you need to get a test.
And then in addition to all that,
there are privacy concerns.
Like how ethical is it to get a photo
of your partner's goods, right?
Obviously, you should never
do that without their consent.
That is illegal in many places.
And you could also run
into revenge porn laws
if you then send it off to a third party
without their consent.
Also, with us, I wanna
take a second to say like,
you should not feel uncomfortable
asking someone for an STI test.
How you do it, that matters a lot.
But making your partner comfortable,
like it should be a kind of nothing.
Back to this news, right?
There are serious
concerns about how Calmara
and other AI companies treat this data.
With Sara Geoghegan, a lawyer
for the Electronic Privacy
Information Center,
putting it this way, saying,
"I don't think a solution is taking photos
of someone else's genitals
and sharing them with an app
that's not even a medical provider
and isn't subject to the same standards
a doctor's office would be."
'Cause yeah, unlike a doctor
and other actual healthcare workers,
Calmara claims that it isn't
beholden to laws like HIPAA.
They're claiming that
its data can't be used
to identify a single person.
Although I don't know how much that makes
would-be patients feel better.
And that's in addition to
there being serious doubts
that Calmara wouldn't
need to follow HIPAA.
They have no way to stop
someone sending a photo
that includes a patient's face,
which would likely be
enough to fall under HIPAA.
Not to mention that the
company likely needs
to navigate a ton of
other data privacy laws
even if the data is anonymized,
and they likely even fail at that.
One thing that's normally
done to protect users
is that companies won't save
data that's sent to them.
But according to one of
the company's co-founders,
"My workers' computers are
filled with penis pictures,"
which I...
On top of that there are
real concerns that Calmara
and HeHealth, another app
made by the same company,
are vastly overpromising about
their app's capabilities.
Right now, I don't just mean because
of the asymptomatic
nature of these diseases
like we talked about,
but also because of the
data that it was trained on.
In a preprint from March,
they claim that the AI
from both apps was trained
on original images of five diseases,
and those images coming from patients
in India, Sri Lanka, Singapore,
Australia, the UK, and the US.
And so that number might
have stood out to you.
They said five diseases.
But the company claims
they can identify 10.
So people have the question of,
"Well, how can they identify 10?"
And adding to the doubts
of the fact that many
of these images are synthetic,
meaning that they used
other AI imaging models
to make up photos of diseased patients.
So to be fair, this is more of a gray zone
when it comes to training AI.
On the one hand, it's not real data
so there are fears that it could skew
how models are trained.
But on the other hand, proponents say
that using realistic synthetic
data can help fill in gaps
in data sets where it can
be hard to get that data
and not run into privacy issues.
And notably with all
this, you have the company
behind the apps claiming
that their capabilities
have been vetted by 30,000 users.
Although again, that doesn't really solve
the other problems with the company.
Carey Lening, who's a privacy
researcher at Castlebridge,
calling Calmara's privacy controls
a "sheer unmitigated disaster"
in a massive report about the company.
The concern though, is that
it's just the tip of the iceberg
and that we're on the verge
of a bunch of companies
claiming that their AI powered programs
can promise the world.
Though again, that's not to say that AI
won't have its uses in healthcare.
Like, a lot of prestigious
and serious hospitals
and institutions like UC Irvine
are looking into how
to leverage its power.
In that case, they're exploring
how AI-powered
conversational health agents
can help sift through patients
and more quickly get to the bottom
of what a patient's
concerns and needs are.
And if done properly,
it could heavily expand
how many patients hospitals can see
and how well patients can be treated.
And it's clear where the world is headed
as companies like Nvidia,
whose hardware and AI
powers much of the tech,
are now looking into shifting
their focus to medicine,
which also isn't surprising
considering it is
a $23 billion market and just growing.
The big difference is
that they're generally
not using this to diagnose
patients like Calmara is.
And they're not rushing
to put it out there.
And really, anything using this tech,
especially in diagnosis
would likely need a lot
of peer reviewing before its use
was considered safe and ethical.
And all of this kinda boils down
to that classic thing of new tech.
It can be amazing,
except for all the cases where it's not.
And often, the times when it's not
it's because things are rushed
and people are looking for a quick buck.
But we'll have to wait to
see how all this plays out.
And then, before we get
into the final segment here,

So get in on that, you're welcome,
and also that brings us
to the final segment, Comment Commentary,
where we dive into the
comments on the last show,
see what y'all were saying,
what you were sounding off on.
Which on the note of sounding off,
there were a lot of comments
about Jesse Watters.
- If you're making $20 an hour to work
at a fast food restaurant, right?
Is that six figures?
Are you making six-
- No, no.
- [Co-Host] I think, 40 grand-
- With a lot of people
like him @mrstarz_ saying,
"Jesse Water's making 5 million a year
yet laughably struggling to
do first grade level math
really makes me believe
you can truly do anything
you want in this world."
The @scorpion saying, "People like him
grew up to rich parents in private schools
and the jobs were lined up for them.
The 'you can do anything'
doesn't work for everyone,
especially if you're out of luck
and your parents are poor."
Which I will say two things.
One, while I can't speak
to Watters, I will say,
you will always in this life come across
a lot of, "pull yourself up
by the bootstraps" saying,
"but nepo baby live in
motherfuckers in your life".
And connections in who you know
play big factors no
matter what your life is.
But also too, and this is not universal,
I'm speaking more kind of like generally.
I am someone that believes
that almost anyone
can do almost anything.
They will say it is for
a very cynical reason.
You know, being in this
very fortunate position
that I found myself in over the past,
you know, 15, 20 years, I've come across
and I've gotten to speak with a lot
of very, very successful
and very wealthy people.
And while, yeah, you
have examples of people
that came from nothing and/or
like they're just so fucking
smart or so fucking driven,
there's also just a lot of people
that have no idea what they're doing.
Trust me when I tell you,
do not waste your time worrying
about imposter syndrome.
Blind confidence, or the
presentation of confidence
trumps almost everything.
In so many facets of life,
actually being qualified for the thing
usually not a requirement.
Scarily enough.
And I say that as someone that I wish,
I wish I had that.
Yeah, I'll just leave that one there.
And then the final thing I'll mention
just 'cause it got fixed,
tonyruiz said, "I'm
surprised your episodes
aren't on Spotify in audio format.
Great work though."
And I also got a number of tweets
over the weekend going like,
"Phil, did you remove your
stuff off of Spotify?"
No, we didn't remove it.
It should now be back up.
Without boring you with all the details,
we're in the midst of
changing a number of things
behind the scenes,
with that including how and
where we upload the show.
That being YouTube, Apple
Podcasts, and Spotify.
As well as creating a
hub over at PhillyD.tv.
That's where we're gonna
start posting show notes,
include a link page for
like all our sponsors.
Having a hub where people
can find all our content
as well as offering other stuff
that I will mention next week.
Don't worry about it for now,
just know that I see your comments
and requests and stuff like that
and we're working on things.
But that is where I'm
gonna end today's show.
As always, thank you for being a part
of these daily dives into the news.
Also, friendly reminder,
grab some of that new gear
over at beautifulbastard.com
while you can.
Some shirts and hoodies gonna
be vaulted somewhat soon.
But, main thing, just remember,
my name's Philip DeFranco,
you've just been filled in.
I love your faces and I'll see
you right back here tomorrow.
♪ You on my mind a lot ♪
♪ Don't need no time, watch ♪
