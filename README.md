# cryptopals-rust

This repository contains my solutions to the [cryptopals
challenges](https://cryptopals.com/) in Rust.

2024-04-19 Update: You know, this project was fun, but the writing of cryptopals
is unclear. I get that it's prompting me to learn on my own, as if I was a real
cryptanalyst encountering a system for the first time, but I literally do not
understand what is being asked or the constraints of the problems sometimes.
It's like author is trying to be clever and curt and gate-keeper-y on purpose.
"You should be able to do this with a shitty, hastily-written problem
description, right?"
